# quiz-game

A windows console game that serves a category of questions in the game form to students. Players need to move the 'H' with arrow keys and "catch" the answer to the question displayed on the right. This program involves file I/O operations for displaying questions and saving leaderboard info.

It is much easier to use CodeBlocks to run this program!
