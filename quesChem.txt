Consider the following equilibrium: H2O(g)+CO(g) <->  H2(g)+CO2(g). A closed container is initially filled with H2O and CO. As the reaction proceeds towards equilibrium the
[CO] and [CO2] both increase
[CO] and [CO2] both decrease
[CO] increases and [CO2] decreases
[CO] decreases and [CO2] increases**

Consider the following equilibrium: 2SO3(g) <-> 2SO2(g)+O2(g). At equilibrium, the rate of decomposition of SO3
Equals the rate of formation of O2
Equals the rate of formation of  SO2**
Is less than the rate of formation of O2
Is less than the rate of formation of SO3

Which of the following is true for all equilibrium systems?
The mass of reactants is equal to the mass of products
Addition of a catalyst changes the equilibrium concentrations
The concentration of reactants is equal to the concentration of products
The rate of the forward reaction is equal to the rate of the reverse reaction**

A system at equilibrium is said to be dynamic because at equilibrium the
Temperature does not change
Macroscopic properties are constant
Forward and reverse reactions continue to occur**
Concentrations of reactants and products are constant

Consider the following equilibrium:  N2O4(g)+heat <-> 2NO2(g). Initially, a 1.0 L container is filled with 2.0 mol of NO2. As the system approaches equilibrium, the rate of reaction of NO2

Increases and [ N2O4 ] decreases   
Decreases and [ N2O4 ] increases**
Decreases and [ N2O4 ] decreases
